Skills
------

**Python:** I would describe my self as an exceptionally strong python
developer. I have production experience with most of the major python web
frameworks. I have shipped API's, template based web sites, GUI tools,
statically generated sites, serverless micro services, and realtime websocket
based applications. I have seen python running at scale and python falling
flat on it's face at scale. I write good, simple, low-state python code that
is designed to be easily understood, easy to replace/refactor, and easy to
test (in that order of priority).

**Go:** This is my second language and the hammer I reach for when python
reaches it's limits. I have been shipping high volume, low latency go code
for over 2 years. I have experience optimising go for both speed and resource
usage and would describe myself as competent gopher.

**Databases:** I have a good working knowledge of MySQL, PostresSQL, and
Redis. I have worked with Mongodb and ElasticSearch often (just not recently),
and have a passable understanding of Cassandra.

**Teams:** I believe that I work well in a small to medium sized team. I aim
to provide velocity to any team I'm part of. I have mentored both junior
developers and non technical staff. I have managed developers in the past and
my ability to communicate concepts and designs is good. I am well versed in XP
and have lots of experience with agile and kind-of-sort-of-a-bit-agile style
set ups.

**System Design:** at a micro level I favour a tracer bullet style of design
that relies on getting code in to production quickly, and then using metrics
to evaluate what the next iteration of development should be. On a macro level
I like domain driven, asynchronous, micro services with minimal
interdependencies.

**API Design:** Having spent the last 4-5 years primarily either writing or
consuming API's I have fairly strong opinions about public API design. API's
should be consistent, easy to deserialise, and provide clear information when
things deviate from the happy path. I recently read *[Consumer-Centric API
Design][consumer-centric]* by Thomas Hunter, and I feel like it neatly
summarises my thoughts and feelings about API design.
