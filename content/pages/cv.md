Skills
------

**Python:** I would describe myself as an exceptionally strong python
developer. I have production experience with most of the major python web
frameworks. I have shipped APIs, template based web sites, GUI tools,
statically generated sites, serverless micro services, and realtime websocket
based applications. I have seen python running at scale and python falling
flat on its face at scale. I write good, simple, low-state python code that
is designed to be easily understood, easy to replace/refactor, and easy to
test.

**Other Languages**: In addition to python, I've worked professionally in
Golang, javascript, typescript, C, Obj-C <sup>\*</sup>, shell, lua, PHP, ASP,
and Perl. I'm hobbiest clojure developer.

**Kubernetes:** I've used kubernetes extensively every day for the last 8
years. I've boostrapped and managed multiple production clusters, implemented
auto scaling (in every direction), and handled years of maintenance and
migrations. 

**Databases:** I have a good working knowledge of MySQL, PostreSQL, and
Redis. I have worked with Mongodb and ElasticSearch often (just not recently),
and have a passable understanding of Cassandra.

**Teams:** I believe that I work well in a small to medium sized team. I aim
to provide velocity to any team I'm part of. I have mentored both junior
developers and non technical staff. I have lead and managed teams and my
ability to communicate concepts and designs is good. I am well versed in XP,
Scrum, and Kanban.

**System Design:** at a micro level I favour a tracer bullet style of design
that relies on getting code into production quickly, and then using metrics
to evaluate what the next iteration of development should be. On a macro level
I like domain driven, asynchronous, micro services with minimal
interdependencies.

**API Design:** Having spent the last decade or so primarily either writing or
consuming APIs I have fairly strong opinions about public API design. APIs
should be consistent, easy to deserialise, and provide clear information when
things deviate from the happy path.
