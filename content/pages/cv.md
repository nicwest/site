Skills
------

**Building Internet stuff:** I have shipped APIs, template based web sites,
GUI tools, statically generated sites, serverless micro services, and realtime
websocket based applications. I have worked on the frontend, backend, and
infra side of the web, and seen applications running at scale and applications
falling flat on their face at scale. I write good, simple, low-state code that
is designed to be easily understood, easy to replace/refactor, and easy to
test.

**Programming Languages**: I would describe myself as an exceptionally strong
python developer and I have been working primarily in that language for the
last decade or so. In addition to python, I've done work professionally in
Golang, javascript, typescript, C, Obj-C <sup>\*</sup>, shell, lua, PHP, ASP,
and Perl. I'm a hobbiest clojure developer.

**Kubernetes:** I've used kubernetes extensively every day for the last 8
years. I've boostrapped and managed multiple production clusters, implemented
auto scaling (in every direction), and handled years of maintenance and
migrations. 

**Databases:** I have a good working knowledge of PostreSQL, MySQL and
Redis. I have worked with Mongodb a fair bit (just not recently), and have a
passable understanding of Cassandra. I'm playing with some of the jamstack
databases at the moment (I like fuanadb).

**Teams:** I have a fair amount of experience working as part of, leading,
and managing small to medium sized teams. My ability to communicate concepts
and designs is good, and I think I'm a good mentor to both technical and non
technical team mates. I am well versed in XP, Scrum and Kanban (although I'm not
really a fan of any of them).
