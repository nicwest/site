I am a web developer living in London and working at [Ingresso][ingresso]. 
I spend most of my time working on a large obj-c monolith, building
microservices in go, refactoring nasty old code, and testing django
applications. I think of my self as a most-of-stack developer, and I'm
happy-ish working on frontend, backend, databases, and server infrastructure.
I am also beginning to enjoy writing documentation, which is . 

From 2010 through 2014 I ran [Stunjelly][stunjelly] with [Edward Knowles][ned].
Stunjelly was a eBook and digital publishing consultancy that specialised
in fixing broken books and producing exciting interactive texts. We won the 
[Best Ebook in the Children's category][award] at the Digital Book World 
Conference with '[A Dinosaur that Pooped Christmas][dinopoop]'.

I'm a heavy Vim user and [enjoy writing Vim script][vim plugins]. I believe
you can tell a lot about a developer by looking at their config files, so here
are mine: [github.com/nicwest/dotstow](https://github.com/nicwest/dotstow).

Technically I'm a furniture designer. I made an decent table once and it was
pretty much downhill from there. I now own a [prusa 3d MkII] and it is quite
simply the best thing ever! I'm enjoying mixing programming with product
design and am creating some truly awful things.

Occasionally I'm not using a computer. Sadly I'm fairly stereotypical. I like
reading (literally only fantasy and historical fiction), cooking, video games,
playing squash, and watching rugby.
