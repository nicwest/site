Several years ago I wrote a plugin for vim called 
[QQ.vim](https://github.com/nicwest/QQ.vim).
I was spending a lot of time in [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/): a tool
for developing web API's. Significant pain point for me  was not having vim
bindings when writing requests, or editing responses. I was having to do a
fair amount of copying and pasting between the browser and vim and it was
having a negative effect on my workflow.
