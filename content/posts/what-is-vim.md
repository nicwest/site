VIM is a program that allows a user to create and modify text files on a
computer. It's a bit like Microsofts Word or Apples Pages (FIXME: this is
actually not true, both of these are word processors, vim doesn't format text
and is not a word processor)

VIM stands for ***V****i* ***IM****proved* and it was released By Bram
Moolenaar in 1991. It's based on a much older editor called *Vi* that was
released in 1976. *Vi* provided a visual mode for a program called *Ex* that
was written before computers had screens.

This legacy provides VIM with it's most obvious feature: It doesn't require
the use of a mouse. It's what's known as a *modal editor*. This means that it
has two modes. One for moving around the document (known as Normal mode) and
another for writing stuff (Insert Mode). Both modes use only the keyboard.

Additionally vim will run in a terminal. (FIXME: explain what this means, too
late now, not enough cookies)

Installed on every \*nix system. (FIXME: meh. who cares)

It's pretty popular amoung programmers. 

The editor can modified.

It's not an IDE.
