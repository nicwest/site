[QQ.vim](https://github.com/nicwest/QQ.vim) is a plugin for vim that lets you do
remote queries over with curl from inside vim. The template for QQ's features
was [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) an awesome browser extension for
chrome. Hopefully this will help people building API's in vim!

My personal highlight of this plugin was implementing 
[Base64 in vimscript](https://github.com/nicwest/QQ.vim/blob/c35c43c6c0fd38e6298ebb95bbc79908334a9210/autoload/QQ/utils.vim#L26-L75)
for Basic authentication. It was all like binary and things.
