Finding the next thing to watch, or listen to, or read, is hard, and it feels
like it's getting harded the more content I consume. I feel like I'm consuming
content faster than quality content is being produced.

I also feel like that can't possibly be true. Many many talented humans have
been making gripping content in one medium or another for meliania, they
continue to do so, in greater and greater numbers, to this day.

So where is it? Why do I feel like i'm scrapping the barrel every time I look
for a book to read on amazon? Why does nothing on netflix appeal to me
anymore? Why for the love of god does spotify think I'm obcessed with german
paradory metal?!

Content discovery is broken.

The issue as I see it is that content is spread out over many providers.
Amazon, netflix, spotify, youtube, steam, etc, only ever get to see what I'm
consuming on thier platform. None of them assemble a holistic picture of my
tastes.
