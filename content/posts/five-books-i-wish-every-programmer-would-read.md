Below are some books that I've really enjoyed, and that have shaped the way I
think about programming.

Design

**Best Practices of Spell Design** - Jeremy Kubica   
[author](http://computationaltales.blogspot.com/p/book.html) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17295145-best-practices-of-spell-design) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1481921916)

There is always going to be a next person in your code base. This book tries
to show you some of the potential land mines you can leave behind you if
you're not careful. It's short, funny and approachable.

**Consumer-Centric API Design** - Thomas Hunter II    
[author](https://thomashunter.name/) | [source](https://github.com/tlhunter/consumer-centric-api-design) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27204162-consumer-centric-api-design) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Consumer-Centric-API-Design-Thomas-Hunter/dp/136498900X/)

Designing good API's is hard. This book is an opinionated set of guidelines
for building RESTful API's while keeping consumers in mind. It's a good
foundation for an organisation looking to bring some consistency to their
public interfaces, it's short, and written for humans.

Testing

**The Cucumber Book** - Matt Wynne, Aslak HellesÃ¸y, Steve Tooke   
[publisher](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwcuc2/the-cucumber-book-second-edition/) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12409185-the-cucumber-book) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1934356808)

This is one of the best practical introductions I've read on the subject of
Behavioural Driven Development (BDD). 


**Working Effectively with Legacy Code** - Michael Feathers    
[author](https://www.r7krecon.com/legacy-code) | [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code) | [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052)

> Code without tests is bad code. It doesn't matter how well written it is; it
> doesn't matter how pretty or object-oriented or well encapsulated it is.
> With tests, we can change the behaviour of our code quickly and verifiable.
> Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse.

This is a guide book on how to write tests in the real world. It provides a
toolkit of testing patterns that will be useful to developers regardless of
language, testing approach, or the life cycle of the code base they work in.
